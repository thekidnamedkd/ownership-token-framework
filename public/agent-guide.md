# OTF agent guide

Orientation for agents and analysts consuming the Ownership Token Framework
data. The framework evaluates how genuinely tokenholder-owned a crypto
protocol is, on evidence, against a fixed rubric.

## The data model in one minute

A **token's analysis** is a join of two things:

- the **framework** — a fixed rubric of ~5 metrics, each with several
  criteria (the *questions*, identical for every token). See
  `/api/v1/framework`.
- that token's **evaluations** — one verdict per criterion: a status, notes,
  and evidence (the *answers*). Delivered composed inside `/api/v1/tokens/{id}`.

Criterion ids encode their place in the rubric: `onchain-ctrl__governance-workflow`
= the `governance-workflow` criterion of the `onchain-ctrl` metric.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Use |
|---|---|
| `/api/v1/tokens` | discovery + cross-token comparison: slim rows with score, status counts, and a `criteriaStatuses` map keyed by criterion id |
| `/api/v1/tokens/{id}` | a full token report: `metrics[].criteria[]` with `status`, `notes`, `evidence[]`; plus `score` and counts |
| `/api/v1/framework` | the rubric: metric/criterion `name` + `about` definitions |
| `/api/v1/faq` | methodology and framework Q&A |

`{id}` is the lowercase token id (e.g. `ldo`, `aave`).

## Status vocabulary (exactly these)

- `positive` — criterion met
- `warning` — partially met / caveats
- `at_risk` — not met (the terminal negative)
- `unevaluated` — not yet assessed
- `reference` — informational, not a judgment

A token's `score` counts only evaluated, non-reference criteria.

The per-token count fields predate this vocabulary and don't match it
one-to-one: `positive` = positive, **`neutral` = warning**, **`atRisk` =
at_risk**. `evidenceEntries` is the total number of evidence items across all
criteria. Trust `criteriaStatuses` / `criteria[].status` for the canonical
labels; treat the counts as pre-rolled tallies.

## Provenance and reproducibility

Every response is `{ data, provenance }`. `provenance.snapshot_id` is a
deterministic content hash of the entire published data set — cite it to pin
exactly what you read. `provenance.commit_ref` ties it to a deployment.
`published_at` may be null in the current serving mode (`provenance.source`
tells you that mode, e.g. `generated`); use `snapshot_id` / `commit_ref` as the
version of record.

## Shape of a response

Every endpoint returns `{ data, provenance }`. The index nests its rows under
`data.tokens`; a token doc is `data` directly. Trimmed:

```jsonc
// GET /api/v1/tokens/ldo
{
  "data": {
    "id": "ldo", "name": "Lido DAO", "symbol": "LDO",
    "score": { "passing": 12, "total": 12, "percentage": 100 },
    "positive": 15, "neutral": 0, "atRisk": 0, "evidenceEntries": 26,
    "criteriaStatuses": { "onchain-ctrl__governance-workflow": "positive" },
    "metrics": [{
      "id": "onchain-ctrl", "name": "Onchain Control",
      "criteria": [{
        "id": "onchain-ctrl__governance-workflow",
        "name": "Governance workflow", "status": "positive",
        "notes": "…",
        "evidence": [{ "name": "…", "summary": "…",
          "urls": [{ "name": "Forum", "url": "https://…", "type": "vote" }] }]
      }]
    }]
  },
  "provenance": {
    "snapshot_id": "…", "commit_ref": "…",
    "published_at": null, "source": "generated"
  }
}
```

## How to use it well

- To analyze a protocol, fetch its token doc and follow the **evidence URLs**
  (onchain explorers, docs, governance forums) — the framework is the map;
  the evidence is the territory.
- To compare protocols, use the index's `criteriaStatuses` map — no need to
  fetch every token doc.
- Statuses are the canonical machine signal; `notes` are human prose context.
- The data updates roughly quarterly; the same `snapshot_id` means the data
  has not changed.
